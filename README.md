## What is this?

This is just a project containing my usual gym workouts.

I use it to share my workouts with others and to keep track of new workouts when i occasionally add them.

## How can I use it?

You could potentially fork it and add your own workouts in the workout directory.
There are probably better web applications for this, i just wanted to make something myself for funs.

## How to start it

1. Clone
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`

You can then modify or add new workouts in the workout directory.
